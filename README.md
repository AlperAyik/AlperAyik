About Me

Hi there! 👋 I’m Alper Ayik, a 22-year-old student and passionate front-end developer. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m currently working on a property listing website focused on usability and data insights. Key features include:
• 🏠 Add & manage property listings
• 🔍 Search and filter homes by price, location, and more
• 📩 Contact page for reaching the company directly
• 📊 Analytics dashboard with charts showing:
  • Most popular areas
  • Average home prices
  • Market trends at a glance

This project is helping me strengthen my full-stack skills while working with real-world data and user-focused design.

Note: I have many more projects that are currently private. Some are still in progress, and others are spread across multiple repositories while I experiment and iterate. If you’re interested in seeing more of my work, feel free to reach out — I’d be happy to share them!
